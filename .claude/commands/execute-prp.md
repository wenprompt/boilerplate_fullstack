## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP**

   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all context and requirements
   - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the PRP fully
   - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed
   - Use Context7 MCP tool to look for up-to-date documentations of the libraries and packages as needed

2. **ULTRATHINK**

   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow.

3. **Execute the plan**

   - Execute the PRP
   - Implement all the code

4. **Complete**

   - Ensure all checklist items done properly
   - Report completion status
   - Read the PRP again to ensure you have implemented everything
   - Review the code to make sure there are no mistakes
